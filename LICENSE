ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
This project has evolved into an independent implementation of enterprise-scale context graphs. While earlier versions utilized concepts from "Higher-Order Knowledge Representations for Agentic Scientific Reasoning" (Stewart & Buehler, 2026), the current architecture has been significantly modified and no longer follows that specific methodology.

We acknowledge the pioneering work of the researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for providing early inspiration in the field of agentic reasoning and hypergraph structures.
