"""Multi-agent reasoning system for the hypergraph context graph.

From Higher-Order Reasoning PDF Section 3, each agent implements
a well-defined categorical operation:

- ContextAgent: 1-morphism composition (path finding via IS constraints)
- ExecutiveAgent: 2-morphism proposal (reasoning dependency identification)
- GovernanceAgent: Coherence verification (diagram commutativity checking)
