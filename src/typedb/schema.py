"""TypeDB schema definitions for the hypergraph context graph.

The schema maps directly to the PERA model described in the TypeDB vs RDF/OWL PDF:
- Entities are first-class with typed attributes
- Relations (hyperedges) natively connect N entities through typed roles
- Nested relations implement 2-morphisms (meta-relations between decisions)
- Closed World Assumption enforces policy compliance

Schema structure from ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md Section 1.2.
